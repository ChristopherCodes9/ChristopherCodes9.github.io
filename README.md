# PACMAN 

## TO RUN IN YOUR OWN EDITOR

1.) Download all the .png files of PacMan and save then in the same directory.
2.) Copy the code from the .html and save it in the same directory as well. 

You should have PacMan running back and forth at the top of the screen, changing directions once it hits the page width threshold. 
This is done by iterating between images in a timed format. 
Hope you enjoy and it is straight forward!
